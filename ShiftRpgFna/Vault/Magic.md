Core Mechanics:
- Status effects
- Large variety
- Health cost
- Elemental damage
- Advanced spell casting
	- Holding L/R trigger/shoulder puts you into a "focus" state. Spells are cast via a sequence of button presses or directional inputs while in focus. This affords the player a massive amount of flexibility in the amount of spells they can carry.

Limitations
- Cast time
- Arcane overheat: Casting spells fills your overheat meter over time. While overheated, spells cost increasing amounts of health. Overheat meter depletes quite slowly, but killing enemies/dealing damage with other weapon types deplete it much more quickly.

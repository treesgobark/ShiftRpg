We need to facilitate the existence of both melee and weapons and guns as viable means of combat in-universe. There has to be a reason for the innovation of different types of melee weapons as well as guns. Why are there so many types? Why are there so many variants? Do they have different purposes? Are they intended for killing fleshy targets? Structures? Robots? Are the weapons improvised from industrial purposes like the rivet gun in BioShock? Is the player character special in some way? Do they use weapons that no one else would use? Are most weapons in this world cobbled together and improvised? Post-apocalyptic? I think a good framework to follow is something X-Punk. This way we can create an alternate history world where melee weapons might have still been in use recently and guns are new technology exclusive to the rich. Actually, a massive disparity in the type of weapons available between the low and high classes could explain types of enemies that use only melee or only ranged. Low-tier baddies could have the lower tech kind of melee weapons mostly but maybe also improvised or scavenged ranged weapons from other sources. Higher-society baddies could be more like nobles how they would carry a melee weapon for honorable duels or close-range encounters and high tech guns for being at range. Do humans fight each other? Is it mostly monsters we're killing? Is the existence of types of weapons a direct result of how durable the average creature/human is in this world? Akame ga kill royal artifact weapons could be all the legendaries in the game. The special weapons were created from some kind of resource that no longer exists or maybe there is only a small amount of it.
